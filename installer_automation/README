Installer Automation
====================

Currently, there is binary data in this git repository. It is merely for
convenience.

Execute 

    ./build_installer-windows.sh

This creates a build directory, copies all relevant files into it and runs
makensis.

The same file could be written as a batch file for Windows. Any takers?

About The Binaries
==================

To build your own binary distribution, download a recent Python release > 3.2.
The best way to get a good starting base is to install Python first and copy the
installed directory. Remove the directory "scripts" inside the Python directory.

Afterwards you have to unzip the Installer file.  Inside you find a file named
"python", if on Windows, rename this one to "python.cab". Extract this file (use
7-zip i.e.). There  you copy `msvcr100.dll` and `pythonxyz.dll`, where xyz is
the version number of python without dots. copy those into your just referenced
folder containing a fresh *copy* of the installed Python.

Now rename the directory to "binary" and add the GladTeX executable. Voila!

Building A Debian Package
=========================

$ sudo apt-get install dpkg-dev dh-python debhelper

$ sh debian.sh
