0.7 

* implement text boxes and frames for books with this specialised markup (not
  present in MarkDown)
* recognize headings with a "\" as line continuation character (Fixes #40)

0.6.1 - Bug Fix Release

* fix page number extractor (new Pandoc JSON API)
* fix `fixpnums` command of matuc: data type error
* allow conversion of documents outside a lecture: single documents don't
  need to be in a lecture, but could be on its own (useful for `matuc conv`).
  This gave a traceback before.
* [regression fix]: show correct path in LaTeX error output (showed directory,
  not full file path)
* fix bug with incorrect LaTeX error output: formulas were counted incorrectly,
  because some of them were treated as code block

0.6

* add new `addpnum` functionality to matuc to allow for better autogeneration
  of page numbers from an IDE
* add new fixpnums subcommand, to allow the correction of incorrectly numbered
  page numbers from a given document
* table of contents:
  * always use / in TOC links
  * print number "0" for chapter 0, instead of omitting it
*  recognize ``` code blocks
*  properly handle cases of improperly closed maths environments + LaTeX errors
  within one document
*  recognize roman numbers as valid page numbers
  * update mistkerl to understand roman numbers
*  Mistkerl:
  * don't flag hyphenated abbreviated wordgroups as error (Fixes #37)
  * Do not treat image descriptions at the end of a file as missing
  * make the math operator checker more robust, only matching whole words

0.5

* use GladTeX -R switch to replace non-ascii characters through LaTeX commands
  before conversion
* performance enhancements
    * write as few templates as possible (only when configuration for a given
        path is different from the previous one); that reduces writes on persistant
        memory)
    * only convert files when they have been modified, so when the last
        modification time of the output file is smaller than the last modification
        time of the input file (unix time stamp)
    * extract title of document from json ast (and hence drop a custom MarkDown
    heading parser); is faster as well
* restructure navbar generation:
  * generate navigation bar (top/bottom of page) on the fly and do not write it
    to the input file
    * allows determining last modification date of a file (had been overwritten by
        each navigation bar generation)
* restructure table of contents generation
  * include all files mentioned on
    <https://elvis.inf.tu-dresden.de/wiki/index.php/Tutorenanleitung>
  * do not localize file paths
  * do not generate the TOC if configured
* report correct line number for formula if LaTeX formula was errorneous and
  GladTeX failed
* crash, if a newer version number was found in the configuration (force users
  to update); that'll hopefully mitigate the issues caused by incompatible
  versions
* Mistkerl:
    * add live view in matuc, refreshing the error list every five seconds
    * drop -s (squeeze blank lines) switch for tty output
    * figure out when a number or a special itemize sign (like +, - or *) is used
      at the beginning of an item in an itemize/enumerate environment and hence
      would unintentionally create a sublist
    * detect image descriptions with 'to do' as unfinished
    * figure out whether somebody uses multiple `\ ` to denote a space and suggest
      `\quad`
    * add checker to find broken image links (where a character like ] or [ has
      been forgotten)
    * add checker reporting umlauts which don't work with plain LaTeX in maths
      environments
    * add checker requiring usage of \min and \max, \sin, etc. instead of using
      the plain text versions in formulas
    * add checker reporting image descriptions which haven't been described yet

0.4

* fix a few regressions with unicode handling on Windows, make subprocess
    handling more robust
* insert correct Semester for new lecture material
* rework internal exception handling, more concise, helpful and includes paths
* rework configuration handling, depends on a path instead on the tool setting
    the correct working directory
    * rework translation handling as well, path has to be supplied now too figure
        out where configuration is
    * fix a untranslated strings
* add more Mistkerl checkers
* correctly insert title into converted documents
* fix more bugs
* remove preparser for mathematical environments, to complex to handle

0.3
 
* add more Mistkerl checkers
* rework Mistkerl to use error class with proper formatting
* fix bugs

0.2 (never released)

* configuration option MAGSBS:GladTeX_opts removed, SourceAutor changed to
    sourceAuthor
     * ignore unknown XML tags (in configuration) and emit warning
* more Mistkerl checkers
    * recognize umlauts in LaTeX documents which have been written as a command
        instead of a proper UTF-8 character and report them
    * recognize a small slection of copy-paste umlaut errors when copying text
        from PDF's to MarkDown documents
    * remove Mistkerl checker which checked whether headings are paragraphs;
        Pandoc is now smart enough
* ignore bilder.md (images.md) when searching for multiple h1 headings per
  chapter
* link image  description with correct text
* add filter which suppresses image chaptions generated by Pandoc
* add pre-parser which checks all mathematical environments
* improve conversion process (simpler, faster)

0.1.2:

* fix error when outsourcing image descriptions
* new Mistkerl checkers
* Mistkerl completely rewritten, now error reports independent from formatting
* most classes are pylint-clean
* uniform interface to convert lecture material
* helpful message if Pandoc is not installed on the system
* etc.

0.1.1

* introduce Mistkerl (lint-alike tool)
* path names (for links) with slashes, even on Windows

0.1: never released
